    "Overall, we see that some cluster are not meaningfull. In particular, cluster 7 is full of movies with no actual descriptions, the plot summary is nothing but a list of the characters and the actors. This is reflected in the words closest to the cluster center : 'role', 'roles', 'rôle'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionnally, some movies with very short to no descriptions appear near multiple cluster centers. This could indicate that a large part of the movies have very short to no description, and are thus forming a large cluster near the origin, while the remaining movies are dispersed in a vector space too large to be able to form actual clusters. \n",
    "\n",
    "This could be solved with an additionnal preprocessing step that ignores movies without a plot description, or by using another way of extraction meaning from our movie vectors that does not rely on clustering, such as a querry mechanism. We will investigate these options for Milestone 3."
