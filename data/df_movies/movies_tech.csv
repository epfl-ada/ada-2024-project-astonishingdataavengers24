Pioneers like Raymond Kurzweil and Hiroshi Ishiguro dream of fashioning intelligent machines that will equal their human creators. In this potential reality, man and machine merge as a single unity. Rejecting evolution's biological shackles tantalisingly dangles the promise of eternal life for those bold enough to seize it. But others, like Joseph Weizenbaum, counter attack against society's limitless faith in the redemptive powers of technology. Eloquent and tactful, he questions the prevailing discourses on new technologies, and their ethical relationships to human life.

Somehow he manages to get the job of a Malayalam teacher at a tuition centre. His wife Geetha works in a consumer store. The couple stays in a rented house owned by Kariyachan. Bharathan is a genius inventor and has a rather inquisitive mind especially as far as scientific matters are concerned. He is always around inventions with little care on what happens around him. He never sticks to any particular job, which lands his family in deep financial troubles. His wife Geetha is upset about all this, but little could she do to avoid her husband from becoming the laughing stock of many who don't understand him. Some people like Kariachan  cleverly usurp the patent rights of some of Bharathan's crude inventions. The few people who come with helping hands are Thankachan, one of his students in the tuition centre and Peter, who goes around finding him new jobs.

One day, on the way to take classes, Bharathan notices a paper rocket-flown by some children-staying midair for an unusually long period of time. This and a few other experiences lead him to a very spectacular discovery relating to gravity. But people around him brand him a lunatic and that leads to many problems in his life. But Bharathan does discover the reason behind the phenomenon is antigravity and claims that he can make flying objects that can be used by man to reach any destination without any fuel, and he suddenly gets famous. But due to over concentration, Bharathan loses his memory about the project. The government brings a psychiatrist to cure him. He finds that with some seemingly fatal interventions, Bharathan could be cured and he could make anti gravity to a workable."

Memo Cruz , works at a factory, one of several sleep dealers. Here, workers are connected to the network via suspended cables connected to implanted nodes in their arms and back, allowing them to control the robots that have replaced them as unskilled labor on the other side of the border. The sleep dealers are called so because one may collapse if one works long enough. The story is told as a flash back, as Memo remembers his home in Santa Ana Del Rio, Oaxaca. His father wants him to participate in growing crops on the meagre family homestead. Memo's passion however is electronics and hacking. The homestead also has dried up on account of a dam built nearby and owned by the private corporation Del Rio Water. Memo and his father must trek on foot to buy water by the bag, while monitored by security cameras armed with machine guns. The media on American hi-def TV shows glimpses of a technological dystopia, although in a positive light with superficial spin-doctoring. As a hobby, Memo is building an electronic receiver that can tap into communications. As he continues to work on it, its range increases to far away cities. One summer, a remote-controlled military aerial vehicle operated by the security forces of Del Rio Water catches him monitoring a frequency used by the drones, an act that warrants a brutal attack. He disconnects in time before the drone can locate him with certainty. On another occasion, he and his brother watch a live TV broadcast about a drone action that is about to destroy a building known to be intercepting drone communication. They quickly realize that the building is their own home where Memo has his equipment, and run to save their father whose life is in danger. However, they are too late, and the vehicle launches a rocket at the father, who had miraculously escaped a first attack on the building, instantly killing him. The pilot of the drone is shown to be Rudy Ramirez . Memo boards a bus to the city Tijuana to find work. The same bus is also boarded by Luz Martínez . Memo notices that Luz has nodes on the wrist for interfacing with the digital network, and asks her where he can get them for free. She tells him that he can find someone, known as a coyotek, to connect him by asking around in a certain alley. Luz has loans and may default. She makes a living by uploading memories to an online memory trading company 'True node' where viewers pay for content. She uploads her memory of meeting Memo. Memo is robbed of his money during his first attempt to seek a coyotek. He finds an abandoned shack to stay at the edge of the city, where other node workers live. Luz gets a sale for her memory of Memo, and a prepaid offer for her next memory of him. Luz finds him and comes to know he is out of money. She helps him get a node-job at a bar, which has the equipment. It so happens that she is the coyotek, having learned from her ex-boyfriend and she does him a favor. Luz tries to upload more experiences. Truenode makes her reveal feelings rather than just the story. The person who requested the information is revealed to be Ramirez working for Del Rio Water. Luz and Memo open up to each other and have a connected sex. Upon receiving the next upload, Ramirez has his doubts confirmed that his work made him kill a good man, though his family disparages his concerns. Memo discovers that Luz has been paid to upload her memories of him, and so he leaves her feeling betrayed. He works over-time at the sleep-dealer, risking exhaustion. Luz writes to him and mails him a recording of her memories as a parting gift. In the meantime, Ramirez has crossed the fortified US-Mexican border to meet Memo. As Ramirez explains himself, Memo tries to run perceiving danger. Ramirez catches up and explains he was under orders and offers to help. Memo rejoins Luz and recruits her help to connect Ramirez into the network. He accesses the Del Rio Water security network to control one of the company's drones. Upon discovery that Ramirez is not heeding orders, Ramirez is pursued by other drones. After heated aerial dogfighting, Ramirez manages to blast a hole in the dam, directly where Memo's father had once tossed a pebble in helpless frustration. Memo receives news from his home and neighboring subsistence farms, celebrations of the return of ancestral waters, albeit not necessarily permanent. Ramirez goes further south in Mexico as he is no longer able to return to his family in the US. Memo moves on with his life in Tijuana."

Venkat, who hails from a middle class family, wants to be a wildlife photographer, but is studying engineering because his father wants him to be an engineer. Senthil, hailing from a poor family, is studying engineering to raise his family's fortunes and get them out of poverty. On the other hand, Pari is studying engineering for his simple passion in machines and devices. Pari believes that success in studying is not achieved by solely memorizing definitions given by textbooks or professors, but by understanding and applying the concepts. He believes that one should follow excellence, not success, as success will come itself if excellence is followed. However, this different approach is sneered upon by the faculties, including the dean of the college, Professor Virumandi ""Virus"" Santhanam . Virus and the faculty favour Pari's classmate Srivatsan , also known as ""Silencer"", who is the complete opposite of Pari, believing in mindless memorising over understanding, in order to reach his goals of corporate and social status. Pari constantly spars with Virus and Srivatsan due to their differences in their educational approaches. Pari also believes in the concept of ""All Is Well"", in which people should focus on the present and live it as it is, instead of worrying over the future as in the case of Senthil, who constantly thinks of the fate of his unmarried elder sister and his paralysed father. Meanwhile, Pari falls in love with Virus' daughter Ria , a medical student, when he, Venkat and Senthil meet her when they accidentally crash her elder sister Swetha's  wedding reception to obtain a free meal. Ria is not impressed with Pari's antics and complains to her father about them. Virus becomes furious with Pari and his friends, labels them as ""idiots"" and tries to break the friendship between the 3 of them by telling Senthil and Venkat that Pari is a bad influence on them. While Venkat refuses to break his friendship with Pari, Senthil believes Virus' words and distances himself from Pari. However, when Pari saves Senthil's father's life, who had suffered a heart attack, by taking him immediately to the hospital where Ria works on the latter's scooter when the ambulance had not come, Senthil becomes grateful to Pari and reconciles with him. Ria too appreciates Pari's practicality and concern for others and falls in love with him. Later, in the semester examination, Pari tops his batch, proving that the his approach to studies does succeed. 3 years later, Pari, Venkat and Senthil break into Virus's house in a drunken state one night to allow Pari to confess his love to Ria. Venkat and Senthil cause a ruckus and urinate on the front door before fleeing. Unfortunately, Virus notices Senthil and the next day, he threatens to expel him unless he snitches on Pari. Not wanting to betray his friend or let down his family, Senthil attempts suicide by jumping from Virus' office window and ends up paralysed. Following his recovery, Senthil discards his fear of the future. Encouraged by Pari, both Senthil and Venkat gain courage to do what they were afraid to do before. Senthil takes a bold and frank approach in a campus interview, while Venkat tries to convince his parents to allow him to pursue his love of wildlife photography. Both Senthil and Venkat are successful in their endeavours. When Virus discovers that Senthil is successfully placed in a company, he creates an extremely tough final semester question paper, so that Senthil fails the examination and would not be allowed to join the company. When Ria learns of her father's plan, she helps Pari and Venkat to leak the question paper by providing them with the keys to her father's office. However, Virus catches them and expels them on the spot. Ria angrily confronts her father, revealing to him that his son  wanted to be a writer, but was forced to apply for engineering in IEC because of him. As he could not get selected there, he committed suicide. At the same time, Swetha, who is pregnant, goes into labour. A heavy thunderstorm cuts all power and floods the streets, making it impossible for the ambulance to reach Swetha, and Ria is stuck at the hospital, where she had gone for work. Pari, Venkat and Senthil, along with other students from IEC, deliver the baby using the available equipment and the inverter developed by Pari, with Ria instructing him via VoIP. When they discover that the newborn baby is apparently stillborn, Pari resuscitates the baby by saying ""All is Well"". Virus forgives Pari and his friends, gives Pari his treasured pen in gratitude and allows them to appear for the final semester examination. Pari eventually graduates as the ""Most Outstanding Student"" in his batch. After the convocation however, Pari disappears and goes into seclusion. 7 years later, Venkat and Senthil set out on a journey to Ooty to find Pari. They are joined by Srivatsan, who is now a wealthy and successful professional in the USA and is looking to seal a deal with a famous scientist and prospective business associate named Kosaksi Pasapugazh. Srivatsan's main intention in finding Pari is to find out whether Pari is more successful than him; they had made a bet 10 years ago on who would be more successful with their study approaches after Pari had humiliated him at a college function. However, when they find Pari's house in Ooty, they find a completely different man: the real Panchavan Parivendan . Confronting the real Pari, they find out from him that their friend was actually a destitute servant boy named Pappu. Pappu, who worked in Pari's household, loved learning, while Pari disliked studies. After seeing the boy's intelligence, Pari's father  agreed to allow Pappu study in Pari's place instead of working as a servant. In return, Pari would pocket Pappu's qualifications and after graduating, Pappu will cease all contact with Pari and his family. Pari reveals that Pappu is now a schoolteacher in Dhanushkodi. Later, Venkat and Senthil find out that as the fake Pari had disappeared, Ria had decided to marry her former boyfriend- a price obsessed banker whom she had dumped when the fake Pari made her realise that he loves his expensive items more than her. Venkat and Senthil rescue Ria from her wedding in Coimbatore and they along with Srivatsan drive to Dhanushkodi. At the fake Pari's school, Venkat and Senthil reunite with their long-lost friend, Ria and the fake Pari rekindle their romance, and Srivatsan mocks the fake Pari for becoming a lowly schoolteacher. He asks him to sign a ""Declaration of Defeat"" document for losing the bet. The fake Pari signs the document and when Srivatsan sees the signature, he is shocked to find out that the fake Pari's real name is actually Kosaksi Pasupugazh. Srivatsan accepts defeat and begs Kosaksi to sign the business deal, which the latter apparently refuses."

However, the research is farther along than the NSA expected and QT's leader Henry Gates plans on using the technology to usurp the leader of the NSA and dominate the world. He uses the prototype to stretch the weekend in order to give the brilliant lead scientist Earl Dopler time to fix the remaining glitch in the technology after his henchmen Richard and Jay prevent Earl's incognito departure at the airport. However, the disadvantage of Earl being in Hypertime for too long was him aging rapidly in real time, as his molecular age continued at the same rate despite time slowing down. However, initially unknown to Gates, Dopler had sent a prototype to a former colleague of his named Dr. George Gibbs. His son Zak discovers the watch accidentally and initially uses it for fun, much to the amusement of Francesca. Once Gates finds out about the leaked prototype, he attempts to retrieve it.

The teens take Dopler hostage and force him to do as they request. As Dopler feels that Dr. Gibbs has been kind to him, he reluctantly agrees to help save Dr. Gibbs. Dopler helps mend the broken watch as well as creating guns which can take someone out of Hypertime and back into normal time. The guns are loaded with paintballs filled with frozen nitrogen, and the low temperature 'freezes' a hit person back into normal time. Dopler helps the kids break in but decides not to go as well. They get caught by Henry Gates, Richard, and Jay. Zak and Francesca are thrown in a cell with Zak's dad. Zak accelerates while in Hypertime and becomes ""light"" . They then manage to break out as the NSA Agents arrive and defeat Gates' goons. Gates is not defeated and knocks Francesca out of hypertime and prepares to do the same to Zak and his dad.

India has an out-of-control nuclear satellite in orbit that is about to reenter the atmosphere at any time, contaminating large areas of the earth. This has caused a massive panic, with everyone trying to flee the likely impact sites. Caught in a traffic jam, impatient and disconnected Claire Tourneur  escapes the highway congestion by taking a side road. Her Dashboard Computer System announces she left the Map Zone Database and is on her own. She then has a couple of odd encounters: first with a pair of bank robbers , and with a hitchhiker being pursued by an armed party. Claire discovers, after falling in love with the enigmatic fugitive, that he is the son of a scientist , and has absconded with the prototype of a secret research project. Multiple government agencies and freelance bounty hunters are chasing him to recover the device. The film has two distinct parts: the first is a mystery; the second a science-fiction adventure. The mystery is about the prototype, what it actually does and why so many people are interested in it. Halfway through the film the focus shifts, as the prototype is revealed to be a device for recording and translating brain impulses— a camera for the blind. The hitchhiker is traveling around the world, gathering images in the device though the reason why is not revealed. During the second part, the reason for his travels is revealed: the hitchhiker has been filming his extended family to bring home to his blind mother . As the chase moves across the globe, the nuclear satellite is shot down, causing an EMP effect that wipes out all unshielded electronics worldwide. The characters wind up in a cave in the Australian Outback, where the recordings are played back. After the death of the hitchhiker's mother, his scientist father discovers a way to use the device to record human dreams. Several characters become addicted to viewing their own dreams, while Claire's estranged lover, a novelist, remains unaffected. He writes a novel about the adventure, which ultimately rescues Claire from her addiction to the device, via the power of words."

World opinion begins to turn against robotics, leading to the U.N. declaring a unilateral ban on further research in 2067. Japan, being home to robotics pioneer Daiwa Heavy Industries, strongly protests this ban, but is unable to prevent its passage. In protest, Japan withdraws from international politics. All foreigners are deported, and further immigration is prohibited. In addition, the R.A.C.E. network is constructed&nbsp;— 270 off-shore installations that cover Japan with an energy field, nullifying all communication with the outside world and making satellite surveillance impossible. Trade and diplomacy continues, but Japan vanishes from the world scene. Ten years later, the United States Navy special warfare unit ""SWORD"" is trying to trap a Japanese informant for Daiwa in Colorado. The instigator, Saito, escapes by cutting off his own leg. Analysis shows the leg is made of bio-metal. SWORD suspects that Japan has concealed extensive development of banned technologies. They embark on an unapproved scheme to infiltrate Japan and to find out the frequency of the R.A.C.E. network, enabling SWORD to gather intelligence on the country. Although the agents successfully enter Japan, they are detected by security forces before they can transmit their data. Vexille is the sole SWORD agent to evade capture, and only her lover Leon survives to be taken to Daiwa's headquarters. Vexille awakens to find Tokyo is now a shanty town ruled by Daiwa. A small resistance movement opposes the company, and uses Vexille's transmitter to successfully transmit the distortion frequency. Maria, the head of the resistance, details the 10 years of secrecy while SWORD studies Japan in shocked horror — the islands are a lifeless wasteland. In 2067, an unknown disease struck Japan and was countered by an experimental vaccine. Actually, the disease was created by Daiwa and the ""vaccine"" was used as an excuse for Daiwa to begin testing experimental nanotechnology. Every Japanese citizen was converted into a form of synthetic life. But there were unforeseen side effects; the conversion was imperfect, resulting in the infected humans losing their free will and becoming just lifelike machines. Some of the nanotech went amok, creating the ""Jags"", giant whirling constructs of semisentient metal that prowl the wilderness. The Jags destroyed all of Japan, save Tokyo which is protected by an inedible wall of ceramic. The Resistance plans to draw the Jags along a service bridge to Daiwa's corporate headquarters, which now stands in the middle of Tokyo Bay. Vexille volunteers her assistance . However, though Vexille and Maria succeed in drawing the Jags to the end of the service bridge, the bridge has been detached from the headquarters, the Jags fall into the sea, and Vexille and Maria are captured. They are taken to Kisaragi, the master of Daiwa, who boasts that his research is nearly complete. And as he needs more test subjects, he is going to invade America. Vexille attacks him with a hidden knife, revealing that his blood is still human&nbsp;— he has not used the process himself. Saito, then strangles him. The town council forces the ceramic gates open, destroying Tokyo and enabling the Jags to enter Daiwa's headquarters. Kisaragi, having somehow survived, shoots Saito and escapes with his research. The underling then releases Vexille and Maria before succumbing to his wounds. Vexille pursues Kisaragi while Maria frees Leon, who shows concern for Vexille, angering Maria. Thus when Vexille prevents Kisaragi's escape in a helicopter, Maria grabs him and holds them together as a Jag devours them. Vexille and Leon are rescued by a SWORD helicopter just as Daiwa headquarters collapses into the bay, along with every Jag in Japan. As Vexille and Leon are flown from a now completely lifeless Japan, Vexille comments that humanity's spirit can never be taken away."

He proposes that the Law of Accelerating Returns—the exponential increase in the growth of information technology—will result in a ""singularity"", a point where humanity and machines will merge, allowing one to transcend biological mortality: advances in genetics will provide the knowledge to reprogram biology, eliminate disease and stop the aging process; nanotechnology will keep humans healthy from the inside using robotic red blood cells and provide a human-computer interface within the brain; robotics, or artificial intelligence, will make superhuman intelligence possible, including the ability to back up the mind. Against this optimistic backdrop of human and machine evolution, concerns about Kurzweil's predictions are raised by technology experts, philosophers, and commentators. Physician William B.

Forty-eight hours earlier, David Wyndham , the same team leader, is informed by his UN superior, Paxton  of a security breach involving another scientist on their project, David's friend and colleague Raja. Unauthorized access of the project's mainframe the night before was made using Raja's access codes. As a precaution he has been removed from the project; but David suspects a more sinister motive. Paxton holds a press conference about their project, codenamed ""EVE"" , which has provided most of Europe's energy for the past ten years beginning in 2010. The project utilizes three high-power particle colliders, located in Geneva, Barcelona, Spain, and Orleans, France. With the project's continuing success, Paxton is enthusiastic that the technology can be utilized worldwide. David, unhappily agreeing with Paxton's claims, confronts her afterward that she has no intention of sharing the technology with the Middle East, which she verifies. Outside the meeting hall David receives a mysterious phone call, then is approached by a reporter, whom he dismisses with a handshake. The reporter furtively copies David's fingerprint from his hand using a piece of tape and stores it in a case. A countdown appears on the screen, reading ""84 Hours to Extinction."" At home, David receives a visit from Raja , who has already surmised that Paxton's plans for the technology. Raja believes he is a scapegoat for the security breach because he is the only Arab with level 5 project clearance. When David rejects his claims, Raja angrily leaves. That night, the ""reporter"" that accosted David dons a lab coat and fake ID to sneak into the Orleans facility. After using a recording of David saying his name and the copied fingerprint to gain access to the lab, he enters a series of codes into the computer. When he is confronted by another employee he uses a silenced dart gun to kill the man. A short time later, after the mysterious man has escaped, the plant explodes, destroying Orleans and a quarter of France including Paris, killing between 20,000,000-30,000,000 people. As he tries to sort out what happened the next day, David meets with Raja again. Raja has been named the top suspect and is running from the police. He is also being watched by Paxton's men, which David learns from Paxton herself. She shows him photos of Raja apparently meeting with the mystery man, a known terrorist named Aziz Khaled. Though stunned by this revelation, David insists he be allowed to go to ground zero to investigate the explosion before judgments are made. Later that night, Raja, pursued by both Paxton's men and the French police, attempts to board a train before being cornered in an underground station. A sudden earthquake allows him to escape. Paxton, watching in her office, nearly cries when the worst hit area by the earthquake is the Middle East, specifically Bahrain, where thousands have perished due to the quake. The next day, Raja calls David near the French-Spanish border, revealing that because the earthquake happened one day after the blast and hit where the EVE grid was absent. He deduces that someone has discovered the Doomsday Equation, which is a set of codes for each collider that, if used, could destroy the world. David and his team travel to Orleans via helicopter but they crash, killing the pilot. They find evidence that a Higgs field has formed, confirming Raja's suspicions. Meanwhile, Raja's electric car runs out of power at the border, leaving him helpless. A few hours later he is abducted by Khaled. David's team, meanwhile, attempts to escape France in a Humvee sent to rescue them only to be caught in a meteor shower. To his horror the ""meteors"" are actually falling satellites, and his team barely escapes. Khaled takes Raja to the Barcelona facility. After murdering all the workers and ordering his men to get as far away as possible, he tries to force Raja into giving him the site's Doomsday Equation, believing the meltdown will not cause the end of the world, but Raja steadfastly refuses. After returning to Geneva, David is taken to the facility, where his family is already sheltered. He concludes that the surviving colliders are feeding the magnetic field, and asks Paxton to order a full system shutdown. After becoming tired of Raja's stubborn defiance, Khaled shoots him in the knee, but doesn't see him grabbing a pen. Raja stabs Khaled in the leg, stunning him. He then shoves the terrorist into the reactor's shaft and Khaled falls to his death. Raja returns to the computer and opens an instant message to Geneva, telling David his suspicions about the Doomsday Equation were right - and the only way to save the world is to increase the system's output and choke the field out of existence, otherwise it will expand into a black hole. Still believing Raja is a terrorist, Paxton cuts the connection and a tearful and distraught David has no choice but to carry out the system shutdown, knowing that this action will only seal the doom of the entire planet and everyone and everything on it. The system announces that the full shutdown will take twenty seconds. David joins his family at the window overlooking the reactor and solemnly assures his oblivious family that things will be okay now that he's fixed the problem. As soon as the system shutdown is complete, the Geneva facility melts down in an explosion exponentially larger than the Orleans disaster. Everything and everyone, including David, his family, the facility's staff, and Paxton, within hundreds of miles of Geneva are incinerated in an instant. A view from outer space shows shock waves from the blast radiating throughout the Earth's surface, a large fissure forming in Europe and cracks forming around the globe. Finally, the Earth's core is breached, and the planet explodes violently. Nothing survives. The film concludes with a shot of pieces of what was once Earth floating through space, followed by a blank screen reading simply, Extinction."

With the proceeds of this work they fund pet science projects that they hope will yield applications sufficient to attract ""VC attention"". After arguing over the project that the group should tackle next, Aaron and Abe independently pursue work on technology intended to reduce the weight of an object. Although the device seems to work as planned, it has a side effect: a timepiece left in the device shows the watch has experienced about 1300 times the amount of time the device was activated for. Abe reasons that they have created a time machine.  After some testing, Abe secretly builds a prototype machine large enough to hold a person and, after traveling back to earlier that day, details the results to Aaron. Abe and Aaron build an additional machine  and decide to cut Robert and Phillip out of the discovery, under the false pretense that the garage has to be fumigated. Abe and Aaron start using the time machines to make money in the stock market, but as their understanding of how the machines work evolves, they become more adventurous with their trips. Their experimentation is cut short by the unexpected appearance of Thomas Granger , the father of Abe's girlfriend Rachel, whose financial backing the group had been trying to procure. Granger's trip appears to have made him comatose, and neither understand how Granger could have discovered the box. Abe is particularly disturbed by this turn of events and concludes that time travel is too dangerous to continue. He attempts to prevent his past self from using the machine for time travel, thereby nullifying all of its consequences, by using a ""failsafe"" machine, which he previously built in secret, to travel back to a point prior to his first trip through time and also prior to his broaching the subject of time travel with Aaron. Having traveled back four days in time using this failsafe point, Abe goes to meet Aaron and collapses. After Abe recovers, Aaron reveals that unbeknownst to Abe, Aaron had discovered this failsafe box and used it to get control. Aaron brought back another box, creating a false failsafe point to make Abe believe that there was still a working failsafe machine awaiting him, and preventing Abe from undoing Aaron's actions. Aaron then reveals that he has been using a recording to recite their conversation from an earlier time. He continues to explain how he encountered, fought, and was subdued by a previous version of himself who used the failsafe to come back and make recordings after drugging the original Aaron. But Aaron convinced his earlier self that since he has the recordings already made that he should continue to act as Aaron. The earlier Aaron leaves, leaving the later Aaron to his plan to redo the events of a party in which a crasher attempted to shoot Rachel Granger so Aaron can become a hero. Abe agrees to try to change the events of the party with Aaron and the two succeed, though it is unclear how many iterations it has taken. Their deceptions and their differing views on the use of the machines unfortunately have destroyed their friendship. Aaron accuses Abe of coveting his family and Abe warns Aaron never to return or interfere with their doubles. Abe stays behind to continue his plan of attempting to prevent the original Abe and Aaron from this timeline — who have no idea of what the others have done — from ever using the machines for time travel, suggesting that he would tamper with the machines in the hope that their doubles would think the experiment a failure and move on to other projects. The earlier Aaron who came back in the failsafe to make the recordings speaks on the phone to an unspecified recipient to which Aaron states he owes a debt. One of the Aarons and a team of French-speaking workers begin construction on what appears to be a building-sized box."

One team member, Gordo , has sexual intercourse while wearing the recorder, and shares the tape with other colleagues, including Hal Abramson . Hal splices one section of the tape into a continuous orgasm, which results in sensory overload that nearly kills him - leading to his forced retirement. Tensions increase as the possibilities for abuse become clear. Karen dons the recorder while working with Michael and Lillian. When Michael plays the tape back, the group realizes that emotional experiences are also recorded. Michael makes a tape of his memories, which he shares with Karen, leading to their reconciliation. Lillian is pressured by backers to admit a former colleague, Landon Marks , whom she sees as part of the military industrial complex. She refuses to have the invention taken over for military use. This stress, coupled with the cumulative effects of her lifestyle, causes Lillian to suffer a heart attack while working alone. Realizing that help cannot reach her in time, she dons the Hat and records her experience as she dies. Following her funeral, Michael decides to experience Lillian's final recording, but nearly dies when the playback causes his body to actually simulate the sensations and effects of a heart attack. Michael modifies his playback console to disconnect the heart and respiration output from the recording. A team of military scientists wanting to discover the Hat's capabilities monitors the equipment, discovering Michael's attempt to replay Lillian's death tape, and force Gordo to experience the playback at the same time as Michael, but with his heart and respiration connected to the simulation - leading to Gordo's death. As a safety measure, Alex orders that the central playback facility be shut down. Michael's experiment is cut short, but witnessing what is essentially a digital near-death experience makes him curious to see the entire tape. The recording is locked away and Michael is told he will never be allowed to view it. Michael protests, but Alex removes him and Karen from the team. Michael makes several attempts to hack into the lab's computers. Hal advises him to look under ""Project Brainstorm"", a program which, Michael learns, the military has created to re-develop the Hat for torture and brainwashing.
